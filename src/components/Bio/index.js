        <p className="ta-c">
          I am a Web Developer with a background in inside sales and have years
          of experience streamlining/optimizing supply chains, finding solutions
          to complex problems, all while providing excellent customer service.
          My experience meeting deadlines allows me to manage my time well and
          excel under pressure. I earned my B.S. from Western Illinois
          University and a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from
          Northwestern University. I am self-motivated, always learning, and
          never afraid to ask questions. I want to create new and exciting
          experiences for users and can provide creative solutions to so. My
          hobbies include sports, cooking, videogames, and live music. One thing
          I can't live without is a good cup of coffee!
